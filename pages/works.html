                    <p>After living in Chilean Patagonia for 12 months, I can say that the Asado is the best dish Chile has. </p>
                    <p>The Patagonia area spans across southern Chile and Argentina, and it is a place full of life and nature. 
                        It is like a place that man has not reached because you can see free-roaming animals like pumas huemúl 
                        and others go through the city as if nothing happened.</p>
                    <p>During this trip to Patagonia, I did not know what a real Asado was until I ate Asado with native people. 
                        It probably was the best Asado I ever had. To cook the Asado, they used Antarctic Beech wood, water, salt, garlic clove, and pebre for 3 hours. 
                        Three hours might sound like a lot of time, but it is a time I am willing to wait again.</p>
